        To reduce code repetition, views are split in multiple sub-components. Some views re-use
        the same components. Due to the nature of "<include>" implementation, it's unforunately not
        possible to compose a view simply by listing the desired components. Instead, which
        component belongs to which view is defined by their "name" attribute.

        To help you find your way around, here's an overview of which view uses which components:
            - "system":
                - background.xml
                - status-indicators.xml
                - system-carousel.xml
                - help.xml
            - "basic":
                - background.xml
                - status-indicators.xml
                - game-info-basic.xml
                - gamelist-textlist.xml
                - help.xml
            - "detailed":
                - background.xml
                - status-indicators.xml
                - game-info-details.xml
                - gamelist-textlist.xml
                - help.xml
            - "grid":
                - background.xml
                - status-indicators.xml
                - game-info-details.xml
                - gamelist-grid.xml
                - help.xml
            - "menu":
                - menu.xml
