# This file is used to declare the custom collections supported by the theme.
# User's collections present in this list will gain their own system view instead
# of being bundled in a generic "Custom Collections" group.
# Built-in collections do not need to be listed here, but I'm adding them for
# completeness and easier reference.
# Note also that using a space as delimiter is required: it permits EmulationStation
# to automatically populate the list of games based on the collection's name.
