    <systemDescription>Abuse is a port of the classic dark 2D side-scrolling platform game originally developed by Crack dot Com and released in 1995 for MS-DOS. A Linux version was also made available at a later date. It had a few limitations the most restrictive of which was that it only ran on an 8-bit display, and only in a window.

This version of Abuse will run at any color depth and supports fullscreen mode, as well as many other new features. It features beautiful lighting, realistic animation and nasty alien-like creatures to destroy.</systemDescription>
