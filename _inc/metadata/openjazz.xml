    <systemDescription>OpenJazz s a free, open-source version of the classic Jazz Jackrabbit games.

OpenJazz can be compiled on a wide range of operating systems, including Windows, macOS, GNU/Linux and BSD flavors. Also ports are available for some homebrew platforms, for example Wii and PSP.

With the demise of DOS-based operating systems, it has become necessary to use emulators to play old DOS games. Jazz Jackrabbit deserves more - and would benefit greatly from new features.</systemDescription>
