    <systemDescription>MSU-MD is a driver that allows CD quality music for properly patched Sega Megadrive games, mimicing the behavior of the CD hardware.

Instead of basing the work on proprietary APIs like md+, MSU-MD is developed as a nice tiny driver which makes interfacing with the Sega CD hardware easier and all using official bios calls. This means that these hacks could run also on official unmodified hardware.</systemDescription>
