    <systemDescription>Pyxel is a retro game engine for Python. Thanks to its simple specifications inspired by retro gaming consoles, such as only 16 colors can be displayed and only 4 sounds can be played back at the same time, you can feel free to enjoy making pixel art style games.

Pyxel's specifications and APIs are inspired by PICO-8 and TIC-80.</systemDescription>
