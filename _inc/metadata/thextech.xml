    <systemDescription>TheXTech is an open-source engine that allows you to play the classic Super Mario Bros. X (SMBX) games from 1.0 to 1.3. It is a recreation of the original SMBX engine that was written in Visual Basic 6 and later ported to C++ and SDL2. The project is hosted on GitHub and is actively developed by Wohlstand and other contributors. 

TheXTech is available as a standalone version for Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, and Nintendo Switch. The engine also supports LunaDLL Autocode (LunaScript) via a memory emulator, allowing you to play more old episodes on TheXTech even on non-x86 processors.</systemDescription>
